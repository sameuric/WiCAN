# CAN network simulator
The present CAN network simulator has been designed in the scope of my master thesis: "Design, testing and simulation of a wireless CAN network".  This thesis has been presented by Sacha MEURICE with a view to obtaining the degree of Civil Engineer in computer science for the academic year 2023-2024.  
Keywords: simulation, CAN network, CAN protocol, networks, wireless, simulator, nodes, controller area network.

*Wired CAN networks are widely used in automotive and industrial environments for their high-reliability, efficient data transfer and optimal bandwidth usage. A recent experiment showed a proof-of-concept implementation of a wireless CAN network that demonstrate the feasibility of wireless CAN networks. Changing the wired physical layer to wireless brings new cases and issues that have not been thought in the rules of the CAN protocol. The goal of this thesis is to study the relevancy of the error management system of CAN networks for wireless CAN networks. This study will be conducted using our own CAN network simulator that is able to simulate both wired and wireless networks.*

## Installation steps

1. Download and install Processing software at [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/download)
2. Copy all source files from this repo into a folder called "WiCAN".
   Sources files *must* be inside a folder called "WiCAN", otherwise Processing will prompt you a warning.

## Launch the simulator

1. Simply double-click on the file "WiCAN.pde", and if Processing is installed, it will automatically launch it.

## How to use it?

Please refer to the complete written thesis available at the ULB library for more information.
